This is a placeholder for the tic-tac-toe.png image.
In a real implementation, you would need to create a proper PNG image file.
For now, you can use any image editing software to create a game thumbnail and replace this file.

<!-- Tic-Tac-Toe Game Image Placeholder - Replace with an actual PNG image showing a tic-tac-toe board -->
<!-- For best results, create a 400x300px image with a clear game representation -->
